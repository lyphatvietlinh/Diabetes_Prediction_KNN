What is KNN?
K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the simplest supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification. It classifies a data point based on its neighborsâ€™ classifications. It stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on similar features. 

When Do We Use the KNN Algorithm?
The KNN algorithm is used in the following scenarios:
-Data is labeled
-Data is noise-free
-Dataset is small, as KNN is a lazy learner
